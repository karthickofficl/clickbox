							<p class="p-md blog-para">Conduct keyword research to discover the ideal keywords. This study enables you to determine the relevance and importance of keywords for your SEO listing.</p>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">You'll prioritize long-tail keywords. These are phrases containing at least three words, such as "textile manufacturing firm." Long-tail keywords improve the performance of your article. These keywords are specialized, so your website will attract more qualified visitors.</p>

								<h6 class="h4-lg">4. &ensp; Head tags help search engines analyze pages.</h6>
							</div>
							<!-- Text -->
							<p class="p-md blog-para">Start by optimizing your header tags if you want to know. Header tags are the titles that show where a new section starts. This section's title is a header!</p>
							<div class="post-inner-img">
								<img class="img-fluid" src="https://clickboxagency.com/images/blog/head-tags-help-search-engines-analyze-pages.jpg" alt="hard-skills-digital-marketing" />
							</div>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">Add your most important keywords to your headers to start optimizing them. You should use your most important keyword in the title of your page. </p>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">This helps Google figure out what your page is about, so you need to put your most important keyword in the title if you want to rank for that keyword. You can use other important keywords in smaller headings like H2s and H4s to help you rank for those phrases as well. </p>

							<div class="single-post-txt">
								<h6 class="h4-lg">5. &ensp; Use internal linking.</h6>
							</div>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">Keep internal linking in mind as you gain knowledge on how to optimise your website for search engines. An often-overlooked facet of search engine optimization is internal linking. This method is useful for ensuring that search engines find and index all of the pages on your site.</p>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">It's possible that Google is missing some of the best pages on your site, which include significant material. If you want Google to index your whole website, you may need to take some active steps to ensure that it does. The use of internal links aids in Google's ability to find and index these sites.</p>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">Use proper anchor text when linking inside your site. Linking your pages together at random will not help your pages become indexed. The content and anchor text used on the page should be a good fit for the linked resources.</p>

							<!-- Title -->
							<div class="single-post-txt">
								<h6 class="h4-lg">6. &ensp; Meta descriptions increase search engine clicks.</h6>
							</div>

							<p class="p-md blog-para">Google displays the page's title at the top of the results page. A brief paragraph summary of the page's content appears just under the title. The meta description is this little text.</p>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">From our viewpoint, meta descriptions do help with search engine optimization. As I said before, this article's main purpose is to teach you how to create fantastic meta descriptions, so I'll take some time to explain why this is the case. You may be motivated to produce better meta descriptions after learning of their influence on search engine rankings.</p>
							<p class="p-md blog-para">There are four factors to the connection between the meta description and search engine rankings:</p>


							<div class="single-post-txt">
								<ul class="digit-list">
									<li>
										<p class="p-md blog-para">‚óè Search engine rankings are not influenced by a page's meta description.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="p-md blog-para">‚óè Users' actions are taken into account by the search engine's indexing system.</p>
									</li>

									<li>
										<p class="p-md blog-para">‚óè In particular, the algorithm takes into account the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2615875?hl=en" style="color:#0000FF;"><u>CTR</u></a> (click-through rate).</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="p-md blog-para">‚óè When optimizing your search engine rankings, the meta description is the single most essential factor in attracting clicks.</p>
									</li>

								</ul>

							<!-- Title -->
							<div class="single-post-txt">
								<h6 class="h4-lg">7. &ensp; Load pages faster</h6>
							</div>


							<p class="p-md blog-para">Websites with a longer load time are more search engine friendly. A slow-loading website might cause visitors to leave and go elsewhere for the information they need.</p>

							<p class="p-md blog-para"> Look at the photos on your site to see how you can speed it up. Images are a wonderful complement to a website, but too many of them may slow load times. Compressing picture sizes may help your site load more quickly.</p>

							<p class="p-md blog-para"> Picture compression may help your site load faster by reducing the size of individual image files. The time it takes for your site to load won't be as lengthy of a factor since the files won't be as big. Reduces the amount of time it takes for your website to fully load. Make your website fast on all devices. <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" style="color:#0000FF;"><u>Check this tool.</u></a></p>
