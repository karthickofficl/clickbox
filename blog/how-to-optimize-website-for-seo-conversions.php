						<!-- Text -->

						<h4 class="h4-lg">Important factors in on-page SEO include:</h4>

						<p class="p-lg txt-justify"><b>Site Speed: </b> How fast your website loads can make a big difference in how many people stay on it instead of leaving. It is a very important part of SEO on a page. Using on-page SEO methods like improving HTML codes, refining meta tags, reducing links on pages, and optimizing the size of media on pages will make your site run much faster. The speed of your site is one of the most important factors in how high it shows up in search results.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">Even Google takes the speed of your site into account when deciding where to put it on the search page.  Improving the speed of your site will help you rank as quickly as possible. You can speed up your site with the help of tools and methods that work well. <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" style="color:#0000FF;">GTmetrix</a>, Pingdom, Ahrefs, and <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" style="color:#0000FF;">Google Analytics</a> all measure how fast a site loads. Google Analytics, SEO, and these great site helpers are all needed. Fosmile's speed uses Speed Page to grade your site from 1 to 10 on both mobile and desktop. </p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify"><b> Image Optimization: </b>This on-page SEO method has two parts: reducing the size of pictures and other media on your website so it loads quickly, and making sure the alt text of images is optimized so search engine bots can see them better. Putting the right keywords in the alt text for your images can help search engines find your page and boost your website's score.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify"><b>Internal Linking:</b>This on-page SEO step involves adding internal links to your pages. Internal links can make it easier for search engine crawlers to find their way around your website, find new and linked content, and rank pages based on how relevant they are. This process also makes it easy for users to find related information on your website without having to click more than once.</p>
						


						<h4 class="h4-lg">What is Off-Page SEO?</h4>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">Off-page SEO is everything you do outside of your site to help it do better and move up in Google's SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). It means working on things like building links from known sites in the same category as you, doing well with social media marketing, getting customers to write good reviews about you on different online boards, etc. Read our full post on off-page SEO techniques if you want to learn more.</p>
                        <p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">ff-page SEO is another type of SEO that has a lot to do with how your website ranks. Off-page SEO is everything you do for SEO that is not on your website. This can include getting backlinks from websites with a lot of authority in your field, promoting on social media, getting reviews, and a lot more.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">Link building and getting backlinks are the most important parts of off-page SEO improvement. Link building is the process of getting links to your site from other relevant sites. This shows the search engines that your content is valuable and authoritative.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">Getting backlinks to your site from other sites with a lot of authority in your field is a great way to show search engines that your content is high-quality, reliable, and relevant. Even though it may be hard to figure out the exact effect of one backlink, getting one from a website with a lot of authority can make a big difference in your results and domain authority.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">Your business can grow with the help of social media outlets. If there is a lot of talk about your website or its content on social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc., search engines will make it easier to find your website. When people share or talk about your content on social media, it can bring you a lot of free traffic, which is good for your SEO.</p>

						<h4 class="h4-lg">What is Technical SEO?</h4>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">Technical SEO is mostly meant to help Google bots understand all of your site's pages so that they can be used in the future. Some of the methods used are making a detailed XML sitemap that works on mobile devices and adding organised data to help web bots sort and group your pages based on the type of content they have. For more information, check out our in-depth post on what technical SEO is.</p>
                        <p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">Technical SEO is a type of SEO that includes improving a website's performance and SERPs (Search Engine Results Page) by reviewing and optimizing technical parts on-site.  Technical SEO is mostly about improving your website's speed and how well it works. For example, search engines like Google often rank websites higher if they have a style that is easy to read and a structure that is easy to crawl. Search engines also favor websites that work well on mobile devices and are easy to use. Search engines could even lower your site's ranking if it has bad technical SEO.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">This kind of on-page SEO has a lot of different parts. For example, you can speed up the time it takes for your page to load by using a safe HTTPS connection and storing information for any video on your page. Other technical SEO aspects include uploading sitemaps, improving the HTML code, meta tags, alt texts, and more.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify txt-justify">Another important part of technical SEO is making sure that each page's HTML is as good as it can be. Schema code is a way to tell search engine algorithms exactly what is on your web pages. This makes it easy for the crawlers to figure out what your page is about, what's on it, and more. In the same way, giving your page the right kind of redirects can also make it healthier.</p>
						

						
						<h4 class="h4-lg">5 Reasons to Optimize Your Website's SEO Conversions</h4>


						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">There are numerous reasons why it is essential to optimize your website for both conversions and SEO. Let's explore five specific reasons that emphasize the significance of continually optimizing your site.</p>
					
					    <h4 class="h4-lg"> Make your website helpful for the people you want to see it.</h4>
					   	<p class="p-lg txt-justify">Sometimes marketers may feel at odds with search engines like Google when their best content fails to rank or experiences a significant <b> drop in traffic after an algorithmic update</b>. However, it's important to understand that your goals and Google's goals align in several ways:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>● Creating the finest material you can for your readers</li>
							<li>● Making your website enjoyable to use</li>
							<li>● Prioritising content that offers substantial value</li>
							<li>● While Google analyzes millions of websites, you should focus on analyzing the behaviors and preferences of your specific audience.</li>
						</ul>
						
						
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">By incorporating SEO techniques, you select primary and related keywords aligned with search intent, craft compelling content that resonates with your audience, and ensure that your website provides all the necessary meta information to help search engines understand your content.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">Optimizing your website for conversions involves guiding visitors towards a specific goal, whether it's encouraging them to join your email list or enticing them to purchase your products. Just like Google, your aim is to deliver exactly what your audience desires.</p>
                        <p class="p-lg txt-justify">By understanding how to optimize   your website for both SEO and conversions simultaneously, you can further these goals and establish a stronger relationship between your site and search engines.</p>
 
						
					
					
					    <h4 class="h4-lg">  Grow Your Organic Traffic</h4>

					   	<p class="p-lg txt-justify">The average business typically spends around <b>1 percent of its total revenue on advertising.</b> For instance, if your business generates $1 million annually, you might allocate $10,000 for advertising purposes. While this may seem like a relatively small percentage, the costs can add up, especially in industries like retail, where advertising expenses are considerably higher.</p>
						
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">On the other hand, attracting organic traffic through SEO is a cost-effective strategy. Although you need to invest time and resources in developing and promoting your content, it is significantly more affordable compared to <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" style="color:#0000FF;">pay-per-click advertising.</a> Off-page SEO also plays a vital role in increasing organic traffic.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">Furthermore, studies have shown that organic search visitors have a significantly higher conversion rate compared to paid search visitors. By investing in growing your organic traffic, even though it may take longer to see results, you can enjoy long-lasting outcomes and generate more conversions.</p>
						
						
						
					    <h4 class="h4-lg"> Capitalize on existing traffic</h4>

					   	<p class="p-lg txt-justify">When visitors land on your website, your goal is to leave a lasting impression and encourage them to return. Understanding how to optimize your website for conversions requires a deep understanding of the user experience. Analyse how visitors navigate your site, identify their scrolling patterns, and determine the frequency of clicks on your <b>calls to action (CTAs).</b> </p>
						
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">When someone signs up for your email list, you can establish future communication with them by sending offers, incentives, and more. You can also encourage visitors to follow you on social media, explore your product pages, and read your blog posts.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">By understanding the needs and preferences of your audience and presenting attractive offers in an appealing manner, you can increase your chances of converting visitors into customers.</p>
						
						
						<h4 class="h4-lg">Force your website to work harder</h4>

					   	<p class="p-lg txt-justify">Anyone can create a website, even a visually stunning one. However, building a website that consistently generates conversions is a more challenging task. The average <b>conversion rate</b> across all industries is less than 2.5 percent.</p>
						
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">To achieve higher conversion rates, you need to closely study your audience and provide them with what they need and expect. By conducting thorough research and applying data-driven insights to your website, you can anticipate a significant boost in conversion rates. When visitors find what they are looking for quickly and effortlessly, they appreciate your brand and develop loyalty.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">While conversions are important, it's crucial to prioritise SEO because, without traffic, conversions are unlikely to occur. Therefore, create a website that offers valuable and engaging content while providing ample opportunities for visitors to convert.</p>
						
						<h4 class="h4-lg">Give your viewers what they expect and what they want.</h4>

					   	<p class="p-lg txt-justify">Consider the following scenario: You operate an e-commerce site selling shoes. A customer searches for the best running shoes on Google, and your website appears in the search results. They read a comprehensive blog post you've written about choosing running shoes, including brand recommendations and information tailored to different types of runners.</p>
						
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">At the end of the article, you offer a free sizing and fit chart for runners as a lead magnet. The visitor signs up for your email list and promptly receives the lead magnet. A few days later, you send them a coupon code for your online store, along with images of running shoes. The customer realizes that your website meets their needs, and the discount incentivizes an immediate purchase.</p>
						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">This example demonstrates the symbiotic relationship between SEO and conversion rate optimization. When you meet the expectations of your audience and assist them in finding what they want, you increase the likelihood of securing a customer.</p>
						
						
						
						


						<h4 class="h4-lg"> Optimizing Your Website for SEO in 8 Simple Steps</h4>

						<p class="p-lg txt-justify">To begin optimizing your website for SEO, follow these steps to boost your search rankings and draw more traffic. Once you have implemented these strategies, you can shift your focus towards conversions while consistently updating and releasing fresh content.</p>
