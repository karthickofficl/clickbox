							<!-- Text -->
							<p class="p-md txt-justify blog-para ">Paid ads are a faster way to get customers and to make sales. Running a paid digital marketing campaign like a social media marketing campaign, Google Ads campaigns are more effective than the above processes. This process is mentioned as SEM (Search Engine Marketing) which is all about running paid advertisements.

As a beginner, it is not necessary to use paid ads, but if you want to get customers quickly, paid ads are worth investing in.
