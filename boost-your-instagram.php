										to promote your product, you still have to engage your followers with your content.<br><br> Instagram keeps on adding a lot of features
										like Instagram reels and story which helps the business owners to keep their target audience engaged.<br><br> The multiple third party
										apps aiding in growing your followers, instagram bots or paying for fake accounts is simply a waste of time and money. There are
										numerous shady companies selling fake followers. Watch out for them, it's not going to help you in the long term.<br><br>Growing followers
										organically contributes to long term customer commitment. A large number of followers are only fancy if you don't engage them with
										strong content that is appealing to your target customers.<br><br> Business owners tend to lose followers if you fail to entertain them with
										trending content. Instagram reels and story assists in producing creative and entertaining contents.</p>

										<h4 class="h4-lg blog-title">3. Post more often</h4>
										<!-- Text -->
										<p class="p-md blog para ">
											Post your content relevant to your brand. Normally an average instagram user posts 2-3 times a week.<br>If you want to bring an awareness
											of your brand, you should post at least 2-3 posts a day.<br>Posting too much a day is annoying and maybe it is likely that you will lose followers.

											Compare these brands, know how they interact with customers and what they post.<br>Your feed should look appealing
											to attract a potential audience. For example, if you are promoting baby food products, make sure that you post
											recipes, some tips and some fun/interesting concepts about babies apart from marketing your regular product.<br>
											This makes your posts more interesting. But post what is relevant to your brand.</p>

											This builds trust and other potential customers will immediately opt to buy the product. But assure that they use the right
											tags when they post. For that when you pack the order, you can include the tags in the thank you note card. This is a proven
											marketing strategy. On seeing the authenticity you will surely acquire a lot of customers.<br><br>Boosting your Instagram followers
											organically has a lot of advantages. You just need high quality content to grow your follower base. Identity, research and
											know your demographics to promote your brand. It is budget free. In addition to it you will have committed long term customers.
