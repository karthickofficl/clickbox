							<!-- Text -->
							<p class="p-lg">Google states that a page must load in under 4 seconds. Anything more than that will mean you have to bid your potential customer farewell. People no longer desire lengthy waits to get desired content. You can use a variety of free tools to figure out what influences your page speed, including Web Page Test and the AMP project.</p>

							<h5 class="h5-md">Be Specific with Product Descriptions
							</h5>
							<!-- Text -->
							<p class="p-lg">Copying and pasting product descriptions is a constant temptation. It gets challenging to describe simple items when you have 100 products for sale on your Ecommerce website. Take a break from writing the product descriptions, go outside, walk for ten minutes, and give your mind a rest to resolve this problem. Your customers will stop being interested in your products if you give in to the temptation of pressing Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.</p>

							<!-- Text -->
							<p class="p-lg">On your Ecommerce website, invite customers to leave reviews. The majority of customers read reviews before making any purchases. Allow negative reviews if they exist because it shows that your website is genuine and authentic. Additionally, it demonstrates how trustworthy and open you are with your clients. This tactic is straightforward but extremely efficient at driving organic traffic.
